Especially that last paragraph, which seemed pretty jarring. This blog is a place where I get personal and hold no punches, so expect to see more of that as time goes on.\\n\\nA few days ago my cousin was ran over by multiple cars and killed. It was a shock to me and many others, including my dad. He talked to me about how sad it was that he did not reach his full potential. He used my cousin\'s death as an example of what I would become if I didn\'t start taking action and get a stable income.\\n\\nMy late cousin was out on the streets. As far as I know, he was just walking around as a homeless man. He had a history of drug use. My dad believes he might have been on drugs during the time of the accident. I didn\'t know much about his personal life because I hadn\'t seen him in about 3-4 years.\\n\\nMy dad gives me lectures about how I need to stop surviving and start thriving. I, however, don\'t see the way I\'m living as surviving or thriving. I would call it adapting. I\'ve talked about my situation in prior posts, but I\'ll go in a bit more detail.\\n\\nIn mid October of this year, I made the trip back home to Houston. I shipped my car back, and am in the process to get it fixed so I can get back to traveling. Including that, my other main goals are balding Gamecube controller buttons to sell at the next Genesis, resting to get back to sprint training, and training my Melee Pikachu.\\n\\nThese are things my dad is fine with. What he\'s not fine with is that I do not have a stable income. I left my jobs at Wendy\'s and Home Depot when I left Albuquerque. That\'s right, I\'m unemployed. And when people are unemployed in this country they are seen as lazy and entitled. \\"Why can\'t they find a job and work like the rest of us?\\" is what I assume pops up in many employed people\'s heads when they see someone like me.\\n\\nMy dad tells me he doesn\'t want me to have the fate of the many male members of my family. I have a transgender older sister who is living a similar life as what my cousin was living through. Right now, she is living on the streets of downtown Houston. I saw her this week for the first time in a few years when me and my dad drove around downtown looking for her. \\"When you see him walking, you\'ll know it\'s him because no one walks like him\\". When my dad saw her walking down the street with a fast, flamboyant gait, my dad knew immediately it was her.\\n\\nWe took her to the nearby Jack in the Box, a place she frequents. A worker there told me she comes by late at night, and he feeds her. My dad orders her some food and leaves to buy her some cigarettes. As we sit beside each other at a table, I try to talk to her a bit.\\n\\nShe\'s very jittery. Almost two times as jittery as when I saw her a few years ago. She responds to everything I say with a fast \\"yeah\\", \\"yup\\", or \\"mhm\\". She stands up and sits back down immediately from time to time. She moves her arms and hands in random patterns. She bangs her head against the back of the seat at times. It was all very unnerving.\\n\\nThe most haunting part of me trying to talk to her was when she looked me in the eyes. She did it before, but they were only fleeting glances. There was one time where she stared at me for a solid 5 seconds. During those 5 seconds I tried to find her old self within her eyes. I wanted to see a small glint of hope that she was still in there, that the drugs didn\'t take her completely. Unfortunately, all I saw was nothingness. It felt as if those wide, blood shot eyes had nothing beyond them.\\n\\nMy dad tells me he wishes that I don\'t become like my sister. He believes we are put on this earth to grow. Not just physically, but spiritually. He also tells me he doesn\'t want to live life worrying about my well-being. But why should I care what he thinks about me? I wasn\'t brought into this world by choice. Why should I have to live my life to quell his worries? I have the free will to do what I want, just like he has the free will to worry.\\n\\nHe brought my sister into this world, and she hasn\'t lived up to his expectations. So what? She didn\'t live up to my expectations either. Do you think I want my sister to be living the way she is? Although I don\'t like the way she\'s living, it was her choice. I won\'t be living my life in hopes that my dad will be proud of me. Whatever I do will be of my own volition, and I won\'t be looking to others for approval."},{"id":"how-life-has-been-going-these-past-few-years","metadata":{"permalink":"/My-Blog2/blog/how-life-has-been-going-these-past-few-years","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-09-29-how-life-has-been-going-these-past-few-years/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-29-how-life-has-been-going-these-past-few-years/index.md","title":"How Life Has Been Going These Past Few Years","description":"An X/Twitter I made on December 31, 2022 about how long the year has felt because of the challenges I have faced.","date":"2025-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Goals","permalink":"/My-Blog2/blog/tags/goals"}],"readingTime":3.77,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Travis Blanks","title":"Jack of All Trades","url":"https://travisblanks.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/endiliey.png","key":"Gekaku","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-life-has-been-going-these-past-few-years","title":"How Life Has Been Going These Past Few Years","authors":"Gekaku","tags":["Goals"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Dealing With Expectations","permalink":"/My-Blog2/blog/dealing-with-expectations"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why I Deleted My Social Media","permalink":"/My-Blog2/blog/why-i-deleted-my-social-media"}},"content":"![An X/Twitter I made on December 31, 2022 about how long the year has felt because of the challenges I have faced.](/img/XSS-1.png)\\n\\n![Another X/Twitter post I made on the same day talking about how my goal was now to reach 10k subscribers on YouTube now that I have reached 1k subscribers](/img/XSS-2.png)\\n\\nThis was a post I made about 3 years ago. 2022 was a great year for me. I traveled to a lot of tournaments, and got to meet so many people; many of which I wouldn\'t recognize if I meet again so don\'t be mad at me please (I can\'t remember all these got dang faces!).\\n\\nAnyway, this X/Twitter post I made was of me reflecting on all the traveling, filming, and editing I did the entire year. I was proud of myself for reaching 1,000 subscribers. I never thought I could reach so many people. It gave me hope for the future, and I was so excited to continue this journey.\\n\\nThen 2023 hit.\\n\\nThis was the worst year of my life.\\n\\nMy Wells Fargo remote job fired me, so I had to stop traveling to work at U-Haul. I had quit my job at U-Haul in 2021 and moved to Albuquerque when I landed the remote job. It felt like I was back at square one.\\n\\nThe remote job was fining me $10,000 because I had breached their contract to stay in Houston. They were ending remote work, but I had no idea I wasn\'t allowed to move. There are Wells Fargo locations everywhere, so I thought I could just work at any location.\\n\\nIn addition to U-Haul, I also decided to work at Whataburger to make more money to pay for the fine.\\n\\nAll of these things hit me so hard. I had no idea what to do. I felt like I had failed. I was just at the top of the world, traveling to several different states and even Canada. Now I\'m stuck in a small fast food kitchen taking orders.\\n\\nAfter a few months working at Whataburger, I decided to quit. My mental health was deteriorating, and it was taking everything in me not to just up and leave while on the shift. They mainly had me at the window taking orders or handing the food out. It was tearing me up inside having to stand in one spot without any freedom of movement.\\n\\nAfter about 7-8 months working at U-Haul, I decided to drive back to Houston for a break. I was only planning to be there for about a month. Unfortunately, my car was having issues, and would not be able to handle the long drive back to Albuquerque. I needed to make some money to fix the car before I could make my trip back. I called my boss at the U-Haul location in Albuquerque and asked him to transfer me to my old location in Houston.\\n\\nThis was an amazing experience. Initially, I felt like an utter failure having to go back to the job I had left when I got my remote job opportunity with Wells Fargo. I was back in the same place I was when I started. It felt embarrassing seeing the coworkers I had told I was leaving for a better job just about a year ago. I thought I was back at square one.\\n\\nHowever, this feeling within me did not remain that way. My coworkers were so kind and understanding. They did not look down or belittle me, they welcomed me and appreciated my presence. I had a lot of fun hanging out with them. It never felt like I was working when I was around them. My mental health was improving through an unexpected source.\\n\\nBefore I left back to Albuquerque, me and my coworkers had a going away party at an Anime bar. I\'m so glad I got the chance to go back to my old job. It not only humbled me, but changed the way I viewed success. I no longer want to work in a office job or even a salaried job. I feel that true success is when you are able to do what you want without fear of failure. The happiness I felt going back to the U-Haul in Houston showed me that as long as I\'m around people who uplift and make me happy, I don\'t care how much money I\'m making."},{"id":"why-i-deleted-my-social-media","metadata":{"permalink":"/My-Blog2/blog/why-i-deleted-my-social-media","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-08-14-why-i-deleted-my-social-media/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-14-why-i-deleted-my-social-media/index.md","title":"Why I Deleted My Social Media","description":"I deleted my social media accounts because they are getting in the way of me accomplishing my goals.

It was my first time camping outside. I can\u2019t believe how fulfilling it is to set up a tent, make a campfire, and just hang out around it.

I didn\u2019t expect to have a good experience because of how boring and tedious my last fast food job at Whataburger was. It turned out to be a slightly more impactful experience than the Youth Corps, believe it or not. I made so many friends, and even got to hang out at one of my coworker\u2019s houses for Christmas. Not to mention the free food!

While I was going to pick up some mail, a UPS worker told me they were hiring, so I decided to apply. Luckily, I was hired immediately, because I wasn\u2019t keen on waiting for another job. I was still in that money making mode. I was a pre-loader, which is a person who loads the trucks with packages before the UPS drivers get there to begin their routes. This job was probably the 2nd physically hardest job I\u2019ve had (The Youth Corps takes the #1 spot because of how hard it is to go several miles uphill and downhill daily) because of how cold it was in the morning. It was also difficult waking up at 4am and walking into the sheer cold.

I\u2019m glad I did this because it showed me what\u2019s truly important to me; and that\u2019s enjoying life and experiencing new things.
