This is my car

I have spent the past few months soft modifying the vehicle. I recently added a roof rack to the top to help with space and a few other things for when I start traveling.

This wrap around the window is a life saver when it’s hot outside
I use these net-like wraps around my vehicle to help with the heat. Without these, I wouldn’t be able to sleep in the car. Before I bought these, I was sweating like a dog!

This is the inside of the vehicle. If you look closely at the two rear doors, you can see that I took off the door panels off. My battery died, so I have to manually open and close the windows when I leave for work. It actually isn’t that annoying. I might leave it off because it gives me slightly more space.

This is a closer look inside of the car. It’s a bit messy, but I’m getting better at organizing as time goes on.

Overall, I think this is an improved version of the setup I had when I was in Taos. I just realized I never talked about the Taos trip. The trip is very important because it inspired me to do what I’m planning on doing. I’ll talk about that in the next post.
