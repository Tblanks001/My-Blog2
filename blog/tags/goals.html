<p>No flashy gimmicks or out-of-this-world ideas. I need to focus on a few things. Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">Sprinting</li>
<li class="">Melee</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing too crazy, just my top 2 goals in life. I won&#x27;t be ignoring my other 2 goals (Dual Hearts and Trombone), I just feel like it&#x27;s important to remain focused on a few things to avoid being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>For sprinting, I want to be able to run under 50 seconds in the 400m dash. I won&#x27;t be focusing on any other race because I feel I perform better over longer distances. My ability to hold form and maintain speed is better than my ability to accelerate.</p>
<p>For Melee, I want to win a tournament. I&#x27;m planning on going to many tournaments around the country this year, and not just majors. I want to travel to the locals of different states, and get a lot of practice in with the people there.</p>
<p>When I feel I have a bit more time, I&#x27;ll finish my Dual Hearts review series and show the world what I&#x27;ve discovered about Dual Hearts. I&#x27;ll also practice my Trombone, specifically working on Flight of The Bumblebee. I won&#x27;t stress too much on these 2 goals this year.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a competitor at heart, so the first 2 goals are a must. Especially sprinting. I&#x27;m turning 28 this year, and I may only have about 6-7 years left in my physical prime. I really want to see how fast I can get.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/My-Blog2/blog/tags/goals">Goals</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/My-Blog2/blog/dealing-with-expectations">Dealing With Expectations</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-12-20T00:00:00.000Z">December 20, 2025</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/endiliey.png" alt="Travis Blanks"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp" translate="no">Travis Blanks</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Jack of All Trades">Jack of All Trades</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>The more I look back on my August 14th post, the more it feels like I need to elaborate more on what I&#x27;m saying. Especially that last paragraph, which seemed pretty jarring. This blog is a place where I get personal and hold no punches, so expect to see more of that as time goes on.</p>
<p>A few days ago my cousin was ran over by multiple cars and killed. It was a shock to me and many others, including my dad. He talked to me about how sad it was that he did not reach his full potential. He used my cousin&#x27;s death as an example of what I would become if I didn&#x27;t start taking action and get a stable income.</p>
<p>My late cousin was out on the streets. As far as I know, he was just walking around as a homeless man. He had a history of drug use. My dad believes he might have been on drugs during the time of the accident. I didn&#x27;t know much about his personal life because I hadn&#x27;t seen him in about 3-4 years.</p>
<p>My dad gives me lectures about how I need to stop surviving and start thriving. I, however, don&#x27;t see the way I&#x27;m living as surviving or thriving. I would call it adapting. I&#x27;ve talked about my situation in prior posts, but I&#x27;ll go in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>In mid October of this year, I made the trip back home to Houston. I shipped my car back, and am in the process to get it fixed so I can get back to traveling. Including that, my other main goals are balding Gamecube controller buttons to sell at the next Genesis, resting to get back to sprint training, and training my Melee Pikachu.</p>
<p>These are things my dad is fine with. What he&#x27;s not fine with is that I do not have a stable income. I left my jobs at Wendy&#x27;s and Home Depot when I left Albuquerque. That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m unemployed. And when people are unemployed in this country they are seen as lazy and entitled. &quot;Why can&#x27;t they find a job and work like the rest of us?&quot; is what I assume pops up in many employed people&#x27;s heads when they see someone like me.</p>
<p>My dad tells me he doesn&#x27;t want me to have the fate of the many male members of my family. I have a transgender older sister who is living a similar life as what my cousin was living through. Right now, she is living on the streets of downtown Houston. I saw her this week for the first time in a few years when me and my dad drove around downtown looking for her. &quot;When you see him walking, you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s him because no one walks like him&quot;. When my dad saw her walking down the street with a fast, flamboyant gait, my dad knew immediately it was her.</p>
<p>We took her to the nearby Jack in the Box, a place she frequents. A worker there told me she comes by late at night, and he feeds her. My dad orders her some food and leaves to buy her some cigarettes. As we sit beside each other at a table, I try to talk to her a bit.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s very jittery. Almost two times as jittery as when I saw her a few years ago. She responds to everything I say with a fast &quot;yeah&quot;, &quot;yup&quot;, or &quot;mhm&quot;. She stands up and sits back down immediately from time to time. She moves her arms and hands in random patterns. She bangs her head against the back of the seat at times. It was all very unnerving.</p>
<p>The most haunting part of me trying to talk to her was when she looked me in the eyes. She did it before, but they were only fleeting glances. There was one time where she stared at me for a solid 5 seconds. During those 5 seconds I tried to find her old self within her eyes. I wanted to see a small glint of hope that she was still in there, that the drugs didn&#x27;t take her completely. Unfortunately, all I saw was nothingness. It felt as if those wide, blood shot eyes had nothing beyond them.</p>
<p>My dad tells me he wishes that I don&#x27;t become like my sister. He believes we are put on this earth to grow. Not just physically, but spiritually. He also tells me he doesn&#x27;t want to live life worrying about my well-being. But why should I care what he thinks about me? I wasn&#x27;t brought into this world by choice. Why should I have to live my life to quell his worries? I have the free will to do what I want, just like he has the free will to worry.</p>
<p>He brought my sister into this world, and she hasn&#x27;t lived up to his expectations. So what? She didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations either. Do you think I want my sister to be living the way she is? Although I don&#x27;t like the way she&#x27;s living, it was her choice. I won&#x27;t be living my life in hopes that my dad will be proud of me. Whatever I do will be of my own volition, and I won&#x27;t be looking to others for approval.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/My-Blog2/blog/tags/goals">Goals</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/My-Blog2/blog/how-life-has-been-going-these-past-few-years">How Life Has Been Going These Past Few Years</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-09-29T00:00:00.000Z">September 29, 2025</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/endiliey.png" alt="Travis Blanks"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp" translate="no">Travis Blanks</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Jack of All Trades">Jack of All Trades</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="An X/Twitter I made on December 31, 2022 about how long the year has felt because of the challenges I have faced." src="/My-Blog2/assets/images/XSS-1-255247b944900704cba9b78bc414e774.png" width="670" height="237" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>This was a post I made about 3 years ago. 2022 was a great year for me. I traveled to a lot of tournaments, and got to meet so many people; many of which I wouldn&#x27;t recognize if I meet again so don&#x27;t be mad at me please (I can&#x27;t remember all these got dang faces!).</p>
<p>Anyway, this X/Twitter post I made was of me reflecting on all the traveling, filming, and editing I did the entire year. I was proud of myself for reaching 1,000 subscribers. I never thought I could reach so many people. It gave me hope for the future, and I was so excited to continue this journey.</p>
<p>Then 2023 hit.</p>
<p>This was the worst year of my life.</p>
<p>My Wells Fargo remote job fired me, so I had to stop traveling to work at U-Haul. I had quit my job at U-Haul in 2021 and moved to Albuquerque when I landed the remote job. It felt like I was back at square one.</p>
<p>The remote job was fining me $10,000 because I had breached their contract to stay in Houston. They were ending remote work, but I had no idea I wasn&#x27;t allowed to move. There are Wells Fargo locations everywhere, so I thought I could just work at any location.</p>
<p>In addition to U-Haul, I also decided to work at Whataburger to make more money to pay for the fine.</p>
<p>All of these things hit me so hard. I had no idea what to do. I felt like I had failed. I was just at the top of the world, traveling to several different states and even Canada. Now I&#x27;m stuck in a small fast food kitchen taking orders.</p>
<p>After a few months working at Whataburger, I decided to quit. My mental health was deteriorating, and it was taking everything in me not to just up and leave while on the shift. They mainly had me at the window taking orders or handing the food out. It was tearing me up inside having to stand in one spot without any freedom of movement.</p>
<p>After about 7-8 months working at U-Haul, I decided to drive back to Houston for a break. I was only planning to be there for about a month. Unfortunately, my car was having issues, and would not be able to handle the long drive back to Albuquerque. I needed to make some money to fix the car before I could make my trip back. I called my boss at the U-Haul location in Albuquerque and asked him to transfer me to my old location in Houston.</p>
<p>This was an amazing experience. Initially, I felt like an utter failure having to go back to the job I had left when I got my remote job opportunity with Wells Fargo. I was back in the same place I was when I started. It felt embarrassing seeing the coworkers I had told I was leaving for a better job just about a year ago. I thought I was back at square one.</p>
<p>However, this feeling within me did not remain that way. My coworkers were so kind and understanding. They did not look down or belittle me, they welcomed me and appreciated my presence. I had a lot of fun hanging out with them. It never felt like I was working when I was around them. My mental health was improving through an unexpected source.</p>
<p>Before I left back to Albuquerque, me and my coworkers had a going away party at an Anime bar. I&#x27;m so glad I got the chance to go back to my old job. It not only humbled me, but changed the way I viewed success. I no longer want to work in a office job or even a salaried job. I feel that true success is when you are able to do what you want without fear of failure. The happiness I felt going back to the U-Haul in Houston showed me that as long as I&#x27;m around people who uplift and make me happy, I don&#x27;t care how much money I&#x27;m making.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/My-Blog2/blog/tags/goals">Goals</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/My-Blog2/blog/why-i-deleted-my-social-media">Why I Deleted My Social Media</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-08-14T00:00:00.000Z">August 14, 2025</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/endiliey.png" alt="Travis Blanks"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp" translate="no">Travis Blanks</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Jack of All Trades">Jack of All Trades</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I deleted my social media accounts because they are getting in the way of me accomplishing my goals. They have become distractions to my mission.</p>
<p>My main goal is to become the fastest human being of all time. Although I have other ambitions, they are not as important as this one. I have decided to do whatever it takes to accomplish this goal. That includes removing the things in my life that have become hindrances.</p>
<p>I actually have 4 main goals, but sprinting is the one I will be spending the most time on. Here they are in order of least to most important:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">Sprinting</li>
<li class="">Melee</li>
<li class="">Dual Hearts</li>
<li class="">Trombone</li>
</ol>
<p>No matter how much I look at this list, I can’t find any way to compromise and fit other things in. I’m barely gonna have enough time as it is to work on these things. After a lot of time thinking and reflecting, I decided to throw away several other goals and just focus on these ones.</p>
<p>I will still be making content (Heck, I’m doing it right now), but I will only be posting content on a few websites and YouTube.</p>
<p>There’s one last thing I want to say. I’ve made some promises to people involving creating videos or playing a certain video game. I want to apologize for not completing those promises. I can no longer live a life where I am not focusing on myself. It has worn me down far too long trying to satisfy others. I am a truly selfish person at heart, and I can not lie to myself any longer. Any action I make from now on will be of my own volition.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/My-Blog2/blog/tags/goals">Goals</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/My-Blog2/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/My-Blog2/about">About</a></li></ul></div></div></div></footer></div>
