This is my first day making a website from scratch. Gotta start somewhere. Ok, so what should I put here? How about a video of me working?

<iframe

  title="Workin' at Home Depot"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowFullScreen
  style={{display: 'block', marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}

This is me working at Home Depot. I am an overnight stocker. This is a full time job. I also work at Wendy’s for the other 2 days out of the week.

I’ve been trying to save up money to start traveling to these video game tournaments again. I’ve moved out of the place I was at, and am sleeping in my car right now to save up money.

This is also practice for when I am traveling. To save money, I’ll be sleeping in my car. I’ll explain more in the next diary entry.
