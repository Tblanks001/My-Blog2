This year I'm gonna keep it simple.

No flashy gimmicks or out-of-this-world ideas. I need to focus on a few things. Here they are:

1. Sprinting
2. Melee

Nothing too crazy, just my top 2 goals in life. I won't be ignoring my other 2 goals (Dual Hearts and Trombone), I just feel like it's important to remain focused on a few things to avoid being overwhelmed.

For sprinting, I want to be able to run under 50 seconds in the 400m dash. I won't be focusing on any other race because I feel I perform better over longer distances. My ability to hold form and maintain speed is better than my ability to accelerate.

For Melee, I want to win a tournament. I'm planning on going to many tournaments around the country this year, and not just majors. I want to travel to the locals of different states, and get a lot of practice in with the people there.

When I feel I have a bit more time, I'll finish my Dual Hearts review series and show the world what I've discovered about Dual Hearts. I'll also practice my Trombone, specifically working on Flight of The Bumblebee. I won't stress too much on these 2 goals this year.

I'm a competitor at heart, so the first 2 goals are a must. Especially sprinting. I'm turning 28 this year, and I may only have about 6-7 years left in my physical prime. I really want to see how fast I can get.
