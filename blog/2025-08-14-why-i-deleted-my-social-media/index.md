I deleted my social media accounts because they are getting in the way of me accomplishing my goals. They have become distractions to my mission.

My main goal is to become the fastest human being of all time. Although I have other ambitions, they are not as important as this one. I have decided to do whatever it takes to accomplish this goal. That includes removing the things in my life that have become hindrances.

I actually have 4 main goals, but sprinting is the one I will be spending the most time on. Here they are in order of least to most important:

1. Sprinting
2. Melee
3. Dual Hearts
4. Trombone

No matter how much I look at this list, I can’t find any way to compromise and fit other things in. I’m barely gonna have enough time as it is to work on these things. After a lot of time thinking and reflecting, I decided to throw away several other goals and just focus on these ones.

I will still be making content (Heck, I’m doing it right now), but I will only be posting content on a few websites and YouTube.

There’s one last thing I want to say. I’ve made some promises to people involving creating videos or playing a certain video game. I want to apologize for not completing those promises. I can no longer live a life where I am not focusing on myself. It has worn me down far too long trying to satisfy others. I am a truly selfish person at heart, and I can not lie to myself any longer. Any action I make from now on will be of my own volition.
