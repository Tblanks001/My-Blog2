After failing to generate much profit from the Rectangle Corner booth we had at Super Nova 2024, I decided to get a few jobs to get more money for the business. I went on Indeed and saw a job as a crew member for the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps. I applied and got a quick response back, which is what I was looking for. I had no interest in waiting it out to see if there were better job offers. I just wanted to make some money and obtain a new experience.

After landing the job, I applied around and got another job at Wendy’s. I was working about 60 hours a week at these two jobs. The Youth Corps job was 8 days on and 6 days off. I would work at Wendy’s on the days off.

I had an amazing time at the Youth Corps. It was my first time camping outside. I can’t believe how fulfilling it is to set up a tent, make a campfire, and just hang out around it. It taught me that there is way more fun to be had outside than being cooped up inside all of the time.

My time at Wendy’s was surprising. I didn’t expect to have a good experience because of how boring and tedious my last fast food job at Whataburger was. It turned out to be a slightly more impactful experience than the Youth Corps, believe it or not. I made so many friends, and even got to hang out at one of my coworker’s houses for Christmas. Not to mention the free food! I’m actually planning on going back to Taos next year, and the main reason for that is because of the people I befriended at this one rundown Wendy’s in the small town of Taos.

After the season at the Youth Corps was over, I decided to stay for a few more months. While I was going to pick up some mail, a UPS worker told me they were hiring, so I decided to apply. Luckily, I was hired immediately, because I wasn’t keen on waiting for another job. I was still in that money making mode. I was a pre-loader, which is a person who loads the trucks with packages before the UPS drivers get there to begin their routes. This job was probably the 2nd physically hardest job I’ve had (The Youth Corps takes the #1 spot because of how hard it is to go several miles uphill and downhill daily) because of how cold it was in the morning. It was also difficult waking up at 4am and walking into the sheer cold. It was slightly easier for me because I would sleep in my car right outside of the facility.

Overall, I would say that my time in Taos was incredible. I can’t believe I had the courage to go and visit the unknown while sleeping in my car, which is another unknown. I had no idea if it would work, but I made it work. I’m glad I did this because it showed me what’s truly important to me; and that’s enjoying life and experiencing new things. And I don’t need to live in a house or apartment to do that.
